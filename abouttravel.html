      <th>Why did you want to become a travel agent?</th>
      <td>I honestly believe that there is so much to learn from going to different places. You are able to walk through pieces of history, learn about different cultures, and meet people that are different from you. I think overall that traveling gives you the opportunity to broaden your world view and become more open minded to people that have different beliefs and morals.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>Do you think you'll start your own travel agency?</th>
      <td>Yes I think so. Right now I am working to build up a client base and get as much experience as possible so that I can do something on my own. I've always wantedt to start my own business, so  I hope to have the opportunity to do so soon.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>Why should I choose you to be my travel agent?</th>
      <td>I am a very organized and detail oriented person. Everything that I do is done with excellence and I can guarantee that any travel plan I make for you and your family won't be half-baked. I love organizing things, I am passionate about world traveling and helpings others travel the world, and I'm frugal. I can get you and your family the best prices for your trip! </td>

    <tr>
      <th>What's is your favorite place that you've traveled to?</th>
      <td>This may be shocking, but it's actually New York. I know New York isn't some crazy place abroad, but I love how magical the city feels. Obviously there are some bad parts, as there are with any place that you visit, but everytime I go there is always something new to do. Whether it be an event going on in Central Park, Fashion Week, a new coffee shop opening up, or even random little pop up shops. New York is expensive and I would never live there, but visiting lets me live out my city life dreams for just a few weeks. It is my mission to help you and your family find and travel to a place that is just as magical to you guys</td>
