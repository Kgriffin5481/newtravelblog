		<h2>Places to Go and Things to See&nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>
		<p><img src="colrome.jpeg" width="275" height="183" alt=""/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 18pt;">Rome is full of cool things to see and historic places to visit</span> &nbsp;. One of the places that I recommend visiting is actually the one in the picture right here! This is a picture of the beautiful Roman Colosseum where citizens of Ancient Rome used to watch various events like gladiator fights and attend festivals. It's amazing to think that this ancient strucutre is still standing and to go all you need to do is buy tickets. I recommend doing that from the Palatine Hill entrance and not the Roman Forum entrance! Keep reading to learn about the other places to visit in Rome!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		<p><img src="romehotel.jpeg" alt="" width="275" height="183" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 18pt;">Make Rome your home away from Home. </span>Obviously if you're&nbsp; traveling abroad, you'll need a place to stay! Lucky for you, you can still live through the culture and history of Rome from your bedroom. One of my favorite hotels in Rome is Hotel Condotti. Right now the prices are $115 per night, but make sure to stay on top of travel prices and hotel prices as they tend to rise in the summer and early fall. There are also may other historic hotels in Rome. Keep reading to learn about other places to stay and find the best websites to book your hotel early and for the best prices.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
